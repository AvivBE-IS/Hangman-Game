# Hangman-Game
I learned Python online bymyself. During the study I made a hanging man game. It was my first step into the Python language. Later, i taught Python using this project, and my students made a similar projects.
The project demonstrates a basic Python commands. In my opinion, the biggest challenge is to build the game logic correctly. 
In my opinion, the course is successful. I really enjoyed studying the course and from the preparation of the final project.
The Hangman game was prepared in the form of a rolling task. After learning a topic, the knowledge must be demonstrated by solving a part of the hanging man game. As the study units progress, the game emerges.
