# Stunning-Hangman-Game
# I learned Python online. As part of the online course I made this game. Later, i taught Python using this project, and my students made a similar project. The project demonstrates a basic command of the Python language. It shows control of the different data structures, how to process data by them and how to make transitions between them. For this, you must know the advantages and disadvantages of each of the structures. 
# The project was prepared in the form of a rolling task. After learning a topic, the knowledge must be demonstrated by solving a part of the hanging man game. As the
study units progress, the game emerges. In my opinion, the course is successful, and was my first step into the Python language.
