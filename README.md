# Hangman-Game
# I learned Python online bymyself. As part of the online course I made this game. It was my first step into the Python language.
#Later, i taught Python using this project, and my students made a similar project.
#The project demonstrates a basic command of the Python language. In my opinion, the biggest challenge is to build the logic correctly. 
# The project was prepared in the form of a rolling task. After learning a topic, the knowledge must be demonstrated by solving a part of the hanging man game. As the
study units progress, the game emerges. In my opinion, the course is successful. I really enjoyed studying the course and participating in the project
